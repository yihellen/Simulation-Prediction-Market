# Simulation-Prediction-Market

Bayesian Prediction Market Simulation. Works for data subject to Bernoulli distribution.
Try ```python simulation_prediction_market.py "./Data/Test_Gaussian.csv" Test_data -d Gaussian``` for a quick start.
Use ```--help``` as a guide.
Play around with the simulation. In time, you'll see it's just an average.
